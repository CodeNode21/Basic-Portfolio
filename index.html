            <p>What got me into web development, you might ask - well, I'll tell you that curiosity has pushed me down a rabbit hole. While working in accounting I realized that there were many repetitive excel tasks that could be done by creating macros. Watching excel record all my moves on it's sheet I figured I could potentially learn how to do that outside excel. So I picked up a book and stareted learning Python. Realizing all the possibilities my mind was blown and I was hooked.</p>
            <p>Currently I'm learning HTML, CSS and soon JS. I just can't wait to have a full grip on these languages. Cool things coming soon...</p>
